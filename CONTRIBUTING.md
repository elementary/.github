# Thanks for Getting Involved! ❤️
elementary is a primarily volunteer organization made up of motivated people like you. We're greatly appreciative of all contributions—big and small—and we're excited to have your join our community!

For comprehensive documentation geared towards new contributors, check out our [Contributor Guide](https://docs.elementary.io/contributor-guide/). This guide covers how and where to get started for both developers and non-developers alike.

## Use of Generative AI
This project does not allow contributions generated by large languages models (LLMs) and chatbots. This ban includes tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, and Devin AI. We are taking these steps as precaution due to the potential negative influence of AI generated content on quality, as well as likely copyright violations.

This ban of AI generated content applies to all parts of the projects, including, but not limited to, code, documentation, issues, and artworks. An exception applies for purely translating texts for Issues, Discussions, and their comments to English.

AI tools can be used to answer questions and find information. However, we encourage contributors to avoid them in favor of using our [Contributor Guide](https://docs.elementary.io/contributor-guide/) and our [community chat](https://discord.gg/pCenUBu). Since AI generated information is frequently misleading or false, we cannot supply support on anything referencing AI output.
